# Aesthetic Direction: Bounding Box Dialect

## Overview
House of Bao merges the organic, soft, and culinary essence of "dumpling" with the geometric, functional, and minimalist principles of Bauhaus. The reconciliation creates a playful yet disciplined visual language where mathematical forms manifest as cute, geometric dumplings with subtle softness.

## Design Language

### Color Palette
- **Primary Colors** (Boundaries): Vibrant for distinction
  - Round: (soft yellow, evokes sky). Embossed?
  - Square: (bold blue, geometric contrast) Debossed?
  - Angle: (warm purple, angular energy)
- **Secondary Colors**: Supporting tones
  - Teal: (for edges, connections)
  - Light Teal: (for empty units, subtle presence)
- **Accent Colors**: Interaction and feedback
  - Off-white: (highlights, selections)
  - Dark Blue: (text, deep focus)
- **Background**: (light grey-blue, clean canvas)
- **Approach**: Muted background with vibrant primaries creates focus on mathematical forms, while soft secondary tones maintain dumpling warmth.

### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Futura or similar geometric sans-serif (Bauhaus influence)
  - Clean, modular letterforms
  - Excellent readability for game UI
- **Secondary Font**: A slightly rounded sans-serif for body text (introduces subtle dumpling softness)
- **Hierarchy**: Bold weights for headings, regular for body, light for hints

### Shapes and Geometry
- **Rounds**: Soft, dumpling-like circular forms with gentle curves
- **Squares**: Stark, geometric squares with sharp corners and clean lines
- **Angles**: Diamond/triangle shapes with precise angles, minimal decoration
- **Overall**: Geometric precision meets organic warmth through color and subtle rounding

## Animation & Interaction
- **Timing**: Snappy and functional (200-500ms transitions) with bouncy elements
  - Form transformations: 300-500ms ease-out with subtle overshoot
  - Selections: 150ms spring animation
  - Wins: 1500ms celebration with gentle scaling
- **Feel**: Functional movements with dumpling playfulness - nodes "bounce" slightly when placed, edges flow like dough being stretched
- **Feedback**: Hover glows, selection pulses, illegal move shakes maintain Bauhaus clarity while adding tactile warmth

## Visual Assets
- **Dumpling Characters**: 64x64px sprites
  - Round: Circular body, simple dot eyes, curved smile
  - Square: Square body, straight-line features, angular eyebrows
  - Angle: Diamond body, sharp eyes, geometric mouth
- **Style**: Geometric but cute, minimalist but expressive

## Implementation Guidelines
- Maintain high contrast for accessibility
- Ensure animations don't hinder gameplay flow
- Use color coding consistently across dialects
- Test on various screen sizes for responsive dumpling scaling

This aesthetic balances mathematical precision with culinary charm, creating an engaging puzzle experience that feels both intellectual and approachable.
