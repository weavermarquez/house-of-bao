Great work yesterday. We established a decent-ish gameStore implementation and even made a very frontend with React. However, I am at the point where I am wondering between whether I should go with React / Pixi, or jump for Phaser. And what sort of physics this is going to need for the animation engine, between force directed graph / meta-ball type stuff to soft body engine?

I still want to explore the bounding box dialect. However, I tried a couple of basic sketches, and ran into several problems that indicate that a physics based approach to animating transitions between states would be most straightforward.

Let's give this an exploratory sketch.

I would like you to implement a canvas based touch-event based drag and drop sandbox depicting containment structures aka containers. These should incorporate soft body physics using matter.js in order to sketch the interaction design. There are three types of containers (and all objects in this system are containers, but when a container is empty they are small and compact enough to be read as a 'unit'): round, square, and triangle. Rounds are not so much circles as they are organic shapes, but they can tend towards being circles. Squares should tend towards sharp quadrilateral shapes. The triangles have more like saw-tooth edges. When a container is inside another container, the parent's new boundaries should be as small as possible *while also being repelled away from its childs' boundaries.* There is an inverse square law relation of repelling force from child to parent boundaries (as well as between sibling boundaries), but there is also a linear force of attraction between siblings, as well as the internal relations between a containers' boundary walls.
