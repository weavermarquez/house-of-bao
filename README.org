* The Problem

One third of American adults do not understand fractions. One half of OECD adults do not understand fractions.

Let's eradicate mathphobia together.

* What is House of Bao?

The House of Bao is a puzzle game where you play with containers: numbers that look like what they mean!

Experience the history of mathematics with an innovative and intuitive system with only three simple rules, designed for human understanding.

Using three simple rules, players learn and understand mathematics at its finest. Building the experience to seamlessly tackle any math problem in day to day life.

* How It Works

House of Bao is based on three simple axioms that let you manipulate mathematical forms:

1. *Inversion*: Opposite boundaries cancel out
   - ~([A]) = A~

2. *Arrangement*: Context distributes across collections
   - ~(A [B C]) = (A [B])(A [C])~

3. *Reflection*: A form and its mirror annihilate
   - ~A <A> = void~

These three rules are all you need to understand any mathematical operation.

See [[file:ARCHITECTURE.org][ARCHITECTURE.org]] for the complete theory and game mechanics.

* For Developers

*Tech Stack*: React + TypeScript, PixiJS v8, Zustand, Vite

See [[file:ARCHITECTURE.org][ARCHITECTURE.org]] for complete technical documentation, system design, and architectural decisions.

* Development Roadmap
** Phase 1: Core Engine (2-3 weeks)
- [X] Set up Vite + React + TypeScript project
- [X] Implement Form data structures
- [X] Implement 3 axioms (Inversion, Arrangement, Reflection)
- [X] Write unit tests for axiom operations
- [ ] Implement win condition checker
- [ ] Implement undo/redo system

** Phase 2: Rendering (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Set up PixiJS integration with React
- [ ] Implement basic node rendering (circles, squares, diamonds)
- [ ] Implement edge rendering with bezier curves
- [ ] Implement hierarchical layout algorithm
- [ ] Add basic click/hover interaction
- [ ] Test with sample forms

** Phase 3: Game Loop (2 weeks)
- [X] Implement Zustand stores (game + progress)
- [ ] Create GameCanvas component
- [ ] Create ActionMenu component
- [ ] Create HUD component (move counter, undo/redo)
- [ ] Wire up interaction: click → menu → action → animation

* Random Thoughts

Re questions: Playtests were on desktop. But I have been mostly demoing to people that I meet out and about on mobile. I think the effect is much stronger when I demonstrate on desktop with my touchscreen anyhow. What I was thinking re: touch and drag was /very/ skeuomorphic in a magical realist way. Creating a physics or ontology of how these objects might spawn and be manipulated that's kind of like a quasi real container. Sometimes I have visions of these containers glowing, or maybe not being quite 'physical' containers but rather 'spaces'. like the 4*2 form might be that instead of it being literally nested containers, it'd be the rounds being 'manipulated' or 'enchanted' by the square 'space' they're within that somehow indicate an action potential. Same with the inversion container -- maybe a mirror world where colours get inverted. dunno. Target devices include iphone and android mobile phones primarily. Tablet should be naturally fine after that. I would absolutely love you to set up a PWA.

: ● Holy shit, that vision is beautiful. The "enchanted by square space" concept, the mirror world inversion - that's not just UI polish, that's a complete aesthetic reimagining of how mathematical operations feel. That's James Algebra as lived experience, not just notation.

Awwwe, thank you :blushing_smile: I really do think that this can revolutionize math education. The situation is dire; one third of american adults do not understand fractions. one half of oecd adults do not understand fractions. I want to eradicate mathphobia. There is a kindergarten program in israel based on laws of form that... the department of education felt threatened by? because of its profundity and openness to a shared secular language of immanence? anyways, some physicist commented on that program saying that it was the purest of mathematics taught to kindergarteners. It saddens me that this is so unknown. But I know the demand is absolutely massive for mobile games based on basic arithmetic. People genuinely get upset at those mobile games with misleading adverts featuring gameplay that is essentially basic math.

This was a neat article. I should take note of this field because I imagine this could be inspiration for new mechanics.

In particular, I thought it was notable that I had never heard of the particular label of /inf/ as the function for the common ancestor of two nodes.
