Yoooooooooooooooooooooo!!! Okay, we're cooking. This image makes me curious: What's inside that house? What does it look like? Is it filled with mathematical tools for humans? Quipu, fingerprints, handprints, abaci, counting tables, compasses, rulers, tallies? buckets, containers, montessori blocks? Venn diagrams, C. S. Peircean diagrammatic logics, lattices, category theory, Laws of Form? Suzhou digits 1200 CE (similar to chinese digits now), Brahmi digits 800 CE, European digits (modern arabic numerals), Egyptian hieroglyphic scripts (tallies, 3000 BCE), Babylonian cuneiform 2000BCE, Arabic digits 800 CE, Chinese rod digits 300BCE (rods), Mayan digits 400CE (dots)? Topographic maps? I hope it feels warm in there -- cause it better have plenty of textiles. Lots of textures. I would prefer more montessori-bauhaus fusion than brutalist.

Please feel free to be less abstract about this --- it is a place of learning but not quite a classroom. A workshop, a coworking space, a lounge. With a mural, couches.
